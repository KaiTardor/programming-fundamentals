'switch' Structure:

                  The switch statement is another conditional structure.It is a good alternative of nested if-else.
It can be easily used when there are many choices available and only one should be executed.

Syntax:
       
      switch(expression)
       {
        case constant 1;
        statement(s);
        break;
   
        case constant 2;
        statement(s);
        break;
                :
                :
                :
        case constant N;
        statement(s);
        break;

        default;
           statement(s);
       }
     
 "break;" causes exit from case body.
