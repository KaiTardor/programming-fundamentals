Array:
      An array is a collection of data that holds fixed number of values of same type. 
      For example: if you want to store marks of 100 students, you can create an array for it.

       float marks[100];
       The size and type of arrays cannot be changed after its declaration.

Arrays are of two types:

        One-dimensional arrays
        Multidimensional arrays


How to declare an array in C++?

        data_type array_name[array_size];

        For example,

        float mark[5];
        Here, we declared an array, mark, of floating-point type and size 5. Meaning, it can hold 5 floating-point values.


Elements of an Array and How to access them?

        You can access elements of an array by indices.

        Suppose you declared an array mark as above. The first element is mark[0], second element is mark[1] and so on.

         Arrays have 0 as the first index not 1. 

How to initialize an array in C programming?

        It's possible to initialize an array during declaration. For example,

        int mark[5] = {19, 10, 8, 17, 9};
