Sorting Arrays:
	sorting is a process of arranging the values of array in a particular order. 
	An array can be sorted in two orders:
	
1.Ascending order:
    In ascending order,the smallest value is stored in the first element of array;second smallest value is stored 
	in the second element and so on.The largest value is stored in the last element.
	
2.Descending Order:
    In descending order,the largest value is stored in first element of array,second largest value is stored in 
	second element and so on.The smallest value is stored in the last element.
	
3.Selection sort:
    Selection sort is a technique that sorts an array.It selects an element in the array and moves it to its proper
	position.Selection sort works as follows:
	Find the minimum value in the list.
	Swap it with the value in the first position.
	sort the remainder of the list excluding the first value.
