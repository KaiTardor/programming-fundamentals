The C++ HEADER FILES:
                    In most C++ programs header file "iostream.h" is used.
The word 'iostream' stands for standard input and output stream.The header
file contains information for various input/output functions and objects 
such as 'cout' stream object ,'cin' stream object etc, used to print output
and to get input. 
Similarly, "conio.h" header file is included to use its function "clrscr()".
The "clrscr()" function is used to clear the screen of the monitor.
