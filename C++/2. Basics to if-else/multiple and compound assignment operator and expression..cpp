MULTIPLE ASSIGNMENT OPERATOR:
                             A single statement that is used to assign a same value to multiple (more than one) variables is 
         called multiple assignment statement.It is also referred to as compound assignment statement.e.g; to assign a value 
         18 to variables a,b,and c, the multiple assignment statement is written as;
                                            a=b=c=18;

COMPOUND ASSIGNMENT EXPRESSION:
                             C++ also provides a shortcut way to add,subtract,multiply,or divide a value to or from a variable.
         The compound assignment expression is used for this purpose. syntax:
                                            variable op=expression;
                                    such as:       x  + =12;



                 SIMPLE                                   COMPOUND 
         
                 x=x+12;                                  x+=12;
                 x=x-12;                                  x-=12;
                 x=x*12;                                  x*=12;
                 x=x/12;                                  x/=12;
                 x=x%12;                                  x%=12;
