PREPOCESSSOR DIRECTIVES:
                        The lines beginning with # sign are directives(instructions) to the C++ compiler.
The instructions that are given to the compiler before the beginning of the source code are called PREPOCESSOR
DIRECTIVES.The prepocessor directives begin with a # sign followed by a word 'include' or 'define'. The part
of the C++ compiler that takes action on the prepocessor directives is called prepocessor.
In C++ "#include" prepocessor directive is used to include the header file into source program.
