THE 'define' DIRECTIVE:
                       THE 'define' is another preprocessor directive used to define an identifier and to assign a value to it,
                       which remains constant during the execution of program.Like other preprocessor directives,the 'define'
                       directive is also used at the beginning of the program.The purpose of 'define' directive is similar to that
                       of 'const' qualifier but difference between these two is:
                       1- 'const' is used as statement.
                       2- 'define' is used as prepocessor directive.
                       
                       syntax of 'define' directive is #define identifier  value. where
                       identifier specifies the name of identifier to which the value is to be assigned.This name cannot be used
                       again in programs as variable name or function name.

                       value specifies the value to be assigned to the identifier.e.g; to assign a value to a constant identifier
                       'PI' the preprocessor directive is written as; #define PI 3.1417
