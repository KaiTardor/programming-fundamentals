CONSTANTS:
         The quantities that cannot change their values during the execution of program are called constants.
         Constants are divided into four types:
 
                                              1- STRING CONSTANT:

         A sequence of characters surrounded by double quotation marks is known as a string constant or a string literal.

                                              2- FLOATING-POINT CONSTANT:

         The numeric values that have decimal part also,are known as float-point constants.The number 1.609 is an example
         of floating-point constant.

                                              3- INTEGER CONSTANT:

         The numeric values that have no decimal part i.e;the whole values are known as integer constants.e.g;0,16,420.

                                              4- CHARACTER CONSTANTS:

         A single character or digit or special character written between single quotation marks is called character
         constant.e.g; x,y,+,a,9 are its examples.   


THE 'const' QUALIFIER:
         You can also declare an identifier as constant.The 'const' qualifier is used to mark a variable as constant.
         The 'const' is also referred to as access modifier.The value of variable cannot be changed after the value has
         been assigned to the variable at the time of its declaration.e.g; to declare a variable PI and to assign value
         3.417 by using 'const' qualifier we write it as;
                                          const float PI=3.417;
