PRECEDENCE IN ARITHMETIC OPERATORS:

1- The operators in the parenthesis () are evaluated first.If there are nested parentheses then the inner
   most is evaluated first.

2- The expressions are always evaluated from left to right.

3- The operators *,/,% have the highest precedence after parenthesis.

4- Lowest precedence is of + and -

5- If there are * and / operators is an expression(both have the same precedence) then the operatorswhich occurs
   first from left to right will be evaluated first and then the next, except you force any operator to evaluate
   by putting parentheses around it.
