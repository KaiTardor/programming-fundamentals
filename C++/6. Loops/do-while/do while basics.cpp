/*
'do-while loop':
          It is an iterative control in C++ language.This loop executes one or more statements while the given condition is true.In this loop, the
          condition comes after the body of the loop.It is an important loop in a situation when the loop body must be executed atleast once.
syntax:
       do
       {
       statement1;
       statement2;
       :
       :
       statementN;
       }
       while(condition);
Difference between while and do-while loop:
           
           
        -->In while loop,condition comes before the body of the loop.
           In do-while loop,condition comes after the body of the loop.
           
           
        --> If condition is false in the beginning,while loop is never executed.
            do-while is executed at least once even if condition is false in the beginning.
